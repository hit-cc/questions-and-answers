# questions-and-answers


Sure, let's go through each of the questions with explanations and examples:

1. **Difference between `null` and `undefined`**:

   - `undefined` represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
   - `null` represents an intentional absence of any object value.

   ```javascript
   let x; // undefined
   let y = null; // null
   ```

2. **Closure**:

   A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer (enclosing) function's scope, and the global scope. It "closes over" variables from outer scopes, allowing those variables to remain accessible even after the outer function has finished executing.

   ```javascript
   function outer() {
     let outerVar = 'I am from outer!';
     function inner() {
       console.log(outerVar); // Accessing outerVar from the outer scope
     }
     return inner;
   }

   const closureFunc = outer();
   closureFunc(); // Outputs: "I am from outer!"
   ```

3. **Event Loop**:

   The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the message queue for tasks to execute, ensuring that the main thread remains responsive.

4. **Promises**:

   Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     setTimeout(() => {
       resolve('Data fetched successfully!');
     }, 1000);
   });

   promise.then((result) => {
     console.log(result); // "Data fetched successfully!"
   });
   ```

5. **Hoisting**:

   Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase.

   ```javascript
   console.log(x); // undefined
   var x = 10;
   ```

6. **`this` Keyword**:

   The `this` keyword refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value depends on how the function is called.

   ```javascript
   const obj = {
     name: 'John',
     sayName: function () {
       console.log(this.name);
     },
   };

   obj.sayName(); // "John"
   ```

7. **Callback Functions**:

   Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed later, often asynchronously.

   ```javascript
   function doSomethingAsync(callback) {
     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log('Task done!');
       callback();
     }, 1000);
   }

   doSomethingAsync(() => {
     console.log('Callback executed.');
   });
   ```

8. **Arrow Functions**:

   Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript.

   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

9. **Prototypal Inheritance**:

   JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects via their prototype chain.

   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
     this.name = name;
   }

   Person.prototype.greet = function () {
     console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
   };

   const person = new Person('Alice');
   person.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
   ```

10. **`let`, `const`, and `var`**:

    - `let` and `const` are block-scoped, and `const` variables cannot be reassigned.
    - `var` is function-scoped.

    ```javascript
    let x = 10;
    const y = 20;
    var z = 30;
    ```

11. **`bind()`, `call()`, and `apply()`**:

    These methods are used to control the value of `this` when invoking a function.

    ```javascript
    const obj = { value: 42 };

    function getValue() {
      console.log(this.value);
    }

    const boundFn = getValue.bind(obj);
    boundFn(); // Outputs: 42
    ```

12. **Spread Operator (`...`)**:

    The spread operator (`...`) is used to combine the elements of arrays or merge the properties of objects. 

    ```javascript
    var arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    var arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

    var combinedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2];
    console.log(combinedArray); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    var obj1 = { name: "John" };
    var obj2 = { age: 30 };

    var mergedObject = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
    console.log(mergedObject); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }
    ```

13. **Higher-Order Functions**:

    Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results.

    ```javascript
    function multiplyBy(factor) {
      return function (x) {
        return x * factor;
      };
    }

    const double = multiplyBy(2);
    console.log(double(5)); // 10
    ```

14. **Closure (Practical Use)**:

    Closures are often used to create private variables and encapsulate data.
    
    Closures are powerful because they allow functions to maintain access to variables from their outer scope even when the outer function has finished executing. This enables functions to have private variables, create data privacy, and implement various design patterns like the module pattern.

    Closures are commonly used in JavaScript for tasks like creating private variables, implementing currying, and handling asynchronous operations.

    ```javascript
    function counter() {
      let count = 0;
      return function () {
        return ++count;
      };
    }

    const increment = counter();
    console.log(increment()); // 1
    ```

15. **Asynchronous Programming**:

    Asynchronous programming allows tasks to be executed without blocking the main thread.

    ```javascript
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Async task completed.');
    }, 1000);
    console.log('Main thread continues...');
    ```

16. **`localStorage` vs. `sessionStorage`**:

    Both store key-value pairs but differ in scope and lifespan.

    - `localStorage` persists data until cleared by the user.
    - `sessionStorage` persists data only for the duration of a page session.

17. **`fetch` API vs. `XMLHttpRequest`**:

    `fetch` is a modern API for making network requests and is promise-based, while `XMLHttpRequest` is older and callback-based.

18. **`==` vs. `===`**:

    `==` performs type coercion, while `===` enforces strict equality.

    ```javascript
    5 == '5'; // true (type coercion)
    5 === '5'; // false (strict equality)
    ```

19. **Handling Errors with `try...catch`**:

    `try...catch` is used to handle exceptions and errors in JavaScript.

    ```javascript
    try {
      // Code that might throw an error
      const result = undefinedVariable / 2;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('An error occurred:', error);
    }
    ```

20. **Event Delegation**:

    Event delegation is a technique where you attach a single event listener to a common ancestor of multiple elements to handle events for all of them.

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById('parentElement').addEventListener('click', (event) => {
      if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
        // Handle the click on an LI element
        console.log('List item clicked:', event.target.textContent);
      }
    });
    ```

21. **Typeof null || []**

    ```javascript
        console.log(typeof null); // Output: object
        console.log(typeof []); // Output: object

    ```
    The `typeof` operator returns "object" when used with `null`, which is considered a bug in JavaScript.

22. **Event Bubbling**

    ```html
        <div id="parent">
          <div id="child">
            <button id="button">Click me</button>
          </div>
        </div>
    ```

    ```javascript
    document.getElementById("button").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
        console.log("Button clicked");
        event.stopPropagation(); // Stop event bubbling
    });

    document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("Child clicked");
    });

    document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log("Parent clicked");
    });
    ```
        
    When the button is clicked, the event bubbles up from the child element to the parent element. Without `event.stopPropagation()`, all three event listeners would be triggered, resulting in the following output:    
    ```
        Button clicked
        Child clicked
        Parent clicked
    ```

23. **Object Mutation**

    ```javascript 
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };

    person.age = 31;
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 31 }

    person.city = "New York";
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York" }
    ```
    
    The properties of the `person` object can be modified after it is created by directly assigning new values to them.

24. **Object.freeze**

    ```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };

    Object.freeze(person);

    person.age = 31; // Modification is silently ignored
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }

    person.city = "New York"; // Addition is silently ignored
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }
    ```

    `Object.freeze()` prevents any modifications to the `person` object, making it read-only.


25. **Object.keys:**
    ```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      city: "New York"
    
    };
    var keys = Object.keys(person);
    console.log(keys); // Output: ["name", "age", "city"]
    ```

    `Object.keys()` returns an array of property names of the `person` object. In this case, it returns `["name", "age", "city"]`.




## Promise

-	A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It is a way to handle asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way.

In JavaScript, a promise can be in one of three states:

1. Pending: The initial state of a promise. It is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. Fulfilled: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation is completed successfully. In this state, the promise returns a value.
3. Rejected: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails. In this state, the promise returns an error or a reason for the failure.

A promise can be created using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a callback function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`. Inside this callback function, you perform the asynchronous operation and call either `resolve(value)` to fulfill the promise with a value or `reject(error)` to reject the promise with an error.

Once a promise is created, you can chain `then()` and `catch()` methods to handle the fulfillment or rejection of the promise. The `then()` method is called when the promise is fulfilled, and it takes a callback function that receives the fulfilled value as an argument. The `catch()` method is called when the promise is rejected, and it takes a callback function that receives the rejection reason as an argument.

Here's an example of using a promise in JavaScript:

```javascript
    function fetchData() {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          const data = 'Data received';
          resolve(data);
        }, 2000);
      });
    }
```
```javascript
    fetchData()
      .then((data) => {
        console.log(data); // Output: Data received
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error(error);
      });
```

In the above example, the `fetchData()` function returns a promise that resolves with the value `'Data received'` after a delay of 2000 milliseconds. We chain the `then()` method to handle the fulfilled value and log it to the console. If an error occurs during the asynchronous operation, the `catch()` method is called to handle the rejection.

Promises provide a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks. They are widely used in JavaScript and are also supported in Angular for handling asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests or working with asynchronous APIs.

## async await

The async keyword is used to declare an asynchronous function, which automatically returns a promise. Within an async function, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected. The await keyword can only be used inside an async function.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of async/await

```javascript
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const data = 'Data received';
            resolve(data);
        }, 2000);
    });
}

async function getData() {
try {
        const result = await fetchData();
        console.log(result); // Output: Data received
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}

getData();
```

## Variable Hoisting:

```javascript
    console.log(x); // Output: undefined
    var x = 5;
```

Even though the variable `x` is accessed before it is declared, it does not throw an error. This is because the declaration is hoisted to the top, resulting in `undefined` when accessed before the assignment.


## Object Mutation:

```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };

    person.age = 31;
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 31 }

    person.city = "New York";
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 31, city: "New York" }
```
    
The properties of the `person` object can be modified after it is created by directly assigning new values to them.

## Object.freeze:

```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30
    };

    Object.freeze(person);

    person.age = 31; // Modification is silently ignored
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }

    person.city = "New York"; // Addition is silently ignored
    console.log(person); // Output: { name: "John", age: 30 }
```

`Object.freeze()` prevents any modifications to the `person` object, making it read-only.


## Object.keys:

```javascript
    var person = {
      name: "John",
      age: 30,
      city: "New York"
    };

    var keys = Object.keys(person);
    console.log(keys); // Output: ["name", "age", "city"]
```

`Object.keys()` returns an array of property names of the `person` object. In this case, it returns `["name", "age", "city"]`.
